The Evolving Threat Landscape - 2025

## •

Expanding Attack Surfaces: The proliferation of IoT,

cloud services, and interconnected systems has

created unprecedented attack surface complexity

## •

Resource Constraints: Security teams are

overwhelmed by alert volume and tool sprawl

## •

Advanced Adversaries: Threat actors are

employing increasingly sophisticated techniques

to bypass traditional security controls

## •

Compliance Pressure: Regulatory requirements

continue to expand while becoming more

technically specific

IoT Security Testing Methodology

Aligned with OWASP IoT Security Testing Guidelines

```

resilience of IoT
devices against

```
```
Se!ing objectives
and gathering
information about
the IoT ecosystem.

```
Reporting and
Vulnerability Validation

```
```
Examining IoT
devices and
networks for
weaknesses.
```
**1. Reconnaissance**
- **Objective Setting** : Scope of the penetration test, including specific devices, networks, and systems to be
    examined.
- **Information Gathering** : Gather information about the target IoT ecosystem. This includes device
    specifications, firmware versions, network architectures, and application interfaces.
**2. Vulnerability Analysis**
- **Static Analysis** : Examine the IoT device's firmware and software without executing them, looking for
    vulnerabilities like hardcoded credentials, insecure configurations, and known vulnerable components.
- **Dynamic Analysis** : Interact with the IoT device and its ecosystem in real-time, attempting to exploit
    potential vulnerabilities in its operating environment, such as weak encryption, buffer overflows, and
    authentication bypasses.
- **Network Analysis** : Analyse the network communications to and from IoT devices for weaknesses,
    including sniffing network traffic to identify unencrypted data transmission and analysing protocols for
    vulnerabilities.
**3. Exploitation**
- **Developing Exploits** : Based on identified vulnerabilities, develop or use existing exploits to test the IoT
    device's resilience against attacks. This includes attempting to gain unauthorised access, escalate
    privileges, or execute remote code.
- **Impact Assessment** : Evaluating the impact of successful exploits on the device's functionality, data
    integrity, and user privacy. This step helps understand the real-world implications of vulnerabilities.
**4. Reporting and Validation**
- **Comprehensive Reporting** : Detailed report that outlines the vulnerabilities discovered, the methods used
    to exploit them, the potential impact, and recommendations for mitigation.
- **Remediation Guidance** : Specific actionable advice for addressing identified vulnerabilities, such as
