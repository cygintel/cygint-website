  "summary": "Reduced external attack surface by 62% through continuous monitoring and systematic vulnerability remediation for a network of 200+ healthcare facilities.",
  "description": "A national healthcare provider with over 200 facilities across the country was concerned about their expanding digital attack surface. With the rapid adoption of telehealth services, patient portals, and connected medical devices, their network perimeter had grown significantly, creating numerous potential entry points for cyber attacks.",
  "challenge": "The healthcare network faced multiple security challenges: a distributed IT infrastructure spread across different locations, a diverse technology stack built over many years, regulatory compliance requirements (HIPAA), and the critical need for system availability for patient care. Their security team lacked visibility into their complete attack surface, making it difficult to prioritize remediation efforts effectively.",
  "solution": "Cygint implemented its Attack Surface Management platform to provide continuous discovery, assessment, and monitoring of the client's digital assets:\n\n1. Comprehensive Asset Discovery: Mapped all internet-facing assets, including forgotten systems, shadow IT, and third-party services.\n\n2. Vulnerability Scanning: Conducted regular automated scanning combined with manual penetration testing to identify weaknesses.\n\n3. Continuous Monitoring: Established 24/7 monitoring for new vulnerabilities, exposed credentials, and configuration changes.\n\n4. Risk-Based Prioritization: Developed a scoring system to prioritize remediation efforts based on criticality to patient care and data protection.\n\n5. Security Integration: Connected the Cygint platform with the client's existing security tools and incident response workflows.",

    "quote": "Before working with Cygint, we were constantly playing catch-up with our security posture. Their attack surface management platform gave us the visibility we needed to take a proactive approach. The continuous monitoring alerts us to new issues before they can be exploited, and our security team now has clear priorities for where to focus their efforts.",
